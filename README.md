# Requirements Satisfied by the Application

The Flask-based password management application presented here serves several key requirements:

Password Generation: The application generates passwords for users based on a unique User ID (UID) provided by the user. It employs a Caesar cipher algorithm to create passwords, adding an extra layer of security.

Password Storage: The application stores the generated passwords alongside the corresponding UIDs in a text file. This enables easy retrieval of passwords for a specific UID at any time.

Password Retrieval: Users can retrieve their passwords by providing their UID. The application searches for the UID in its records and returns the associated password if found.

Error Handling: The application includes error handling to deal with cases where UIDs already exist or are not found in the records.

Web API Interface: It provides a user-friendly API accessible through HTTP requests, making it easy to integrate with other applications or services.

Security: While this application uses a simple Caesar cipher for password generation, it demonstrates the concept of securely managing passwords by not storing them in plain text. In practice, a stronger password hashing method should be employed for better security.
